# Reinforcement-learning (In-progress)
I'm trying to implement some reinforcement-learning algorithms. Most of my implementation based on [Richard Sutton's & Andrew Barto's Book Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Ed)][1] and [David Silver's Lecture][2]. And my code not just a rewrite from [Denny Britz's Repo][3], I can't write such a beautiful code like he does yet :( So I try to implement it by myself and when I confuse I try to see how Denny Britz Implement it
